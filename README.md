# Ryanâ€™s dotfiles

## Setup

Run this, need command line tools for git and stuffs.

```bash
$ sudo softwareupdate -i -a --restart
```

Once all updated,

```bash

```

To setup clone the repository from your home directory

Setup [Sublime](/sublime) Text 3 and packages/settings


#### Linting with Sublime
Confirm setup and install PHPCS, follow this [epic guide](https://webdevstudios.com/2017/04/06/lint-code-like-boss/)


After, if you wish to setup OS X preferences run,
##### Note* open chrome first, so its settings in setup will be applied.

```bash
$ ./setup-prefs
```

### Be sure you read through what the scripts do first! Questions, [just ask](https://github.com/thatryan/dotfiles/issues).

## Local Config Files

ln -s ~/Dropbox/local-dotfiles/.gitconfig.local ~/.gitconfig.local
```
